                        Have you ever wondered what it would be like to attend a special school, set in Classical times, surrounded by other high thinkers, scholars, and philosophers? Maybe you are not too sold on wearing a tunic though, however, we can appreciate it from our Modern viewpoint. We are speaking of one of the most well-known paintings from the Renaissance by an artist we are all familiar with, The School of Athens by Raphael. This is the painting we will discuss further in the article below.
                        <br><br>
                        Raphael, who painted The School of Athens around the years 1509, was amongst some of the High Renaissance masters, he was one of “The Big Three”, namely Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. His iconic painting has lived on for hundreds of years and is now among one of the most revered Renaissance paintings. This article will discuss The School of Athens analysis by first providing a contextual background.

                        We will discuss the period Raphael painted in, notably the High Renaissance, as well as why he painted it.

                        We will then discuss the formal elements of The School of Athens painting by looking at the subject matter, Raphael's utilization of color, line, and perspective. We will also answer some interesting questions, for example: what is Plato's gesture in The School of Athens, and what is meant by it? Why were the Greek god Apollo and the goddess Athena included in The School of Athens? All part and parcel of what makes this painting so unique. Let us look further.
                        <br><br>
                        Raphael moved to Rome during the year 1508, this was the third phase of his life as it has been described by the Italian historian and writer, Giorgio Vasari. The first phase was in Umbria and the second phase was most likely from around 1504 up until 1508.

                        During Raphael's time in Umbria and Florence, his artistic styles developed and changed. In Umbria, he was known to have two prominent teachers, namely, Timoteo Viti and Pietro Perugino. During his time in Umbria, he also received several commissions for altarpieces, for example, Coronation of the Virgin (1502) and The Marriage of the Virgin (1504).
                        <br><br>
                        He was influenced by various great artistic names during his Florence years. The familiar names of Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, who were also artistic “rivals” as they have been known. The techniques da Vinci utilized, sfumato and chiaroscuro, became some of the techniques Raphael also applied to his paintings.

                        He was known for creating a unique personal style; however, he also ruffled some feathers and was accused of stealing these techniques and styles.
                        <br><br>
                        During Raphael's time in Florence, he painted pieces like La belle jardinière (1507) and The Entombment (1507). The latter painting has been known as closely resembling that of Michelangelo's paintings of the same subject matter and a testament to how Raphael as an artist experimented and gained inspiration from these other artists.
                        Raphael's life in Rome, as mentioned, started around 1508. He was reportedly invited by the then Pope Julius II (1503 to 1513) to paint the interior walls of the Pope's palatial suites. The artist ended up living in Rome and painted for the successive Pope Leo X (1531 to 1521).
