                            What is 3D art and how do we define three-dimensional art? If we refer to anything that can be viewed from all sides and touched as three-dimensional art, then it becomes apparent that much of art has been 3D throughout time, such as the first beads that were worn, or the early clay sculptures made by our ancestors. Nowadays though, 3D has come to encompass many mediums and forms beyond the traditional sculptural types and several exist that cross the boundary between 2D and 3D art such as three-dimensional paintings. Let's explore this style further by looking at various three-dimensional art examples and types.

                            What Is 3D Art?
                        </h2>

                        <p>
                            Three-dimensional art objects possess physical space and can be seen from all angles and sides since they are represented in the dimensions of height, breadth, and depth. Two-dimensional art, on the other hand, can only be perceived in dimensions of height and breadth since they are produced on flat surfaces.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Classic three-dimensional media such as reliefs and sculptures have existed since the dawn of time as proof of people's yearning for artistic expressiveness.

                            For ages, sculptures have been the main three-dimensional art forms, changing continuously across different time periods of art history. However, innovative art groups that flourished in the 20th century questioned the traditional idea of fine art by employing unorthodox art mediums to communicate their aesthetics and beliefs. As a result of this process, performance and installation art emerged as modern versions of three-dimensional media.

                            Statues and Sculptures
                        </h2>

                        <p>
                            Originally, humans made sculptures out of wood and stone. A little, stone-carved female figure from 230,000 years ago was the first preserved art piece. Throughout Europe, similar figures have been discovered.

                            These statues are said to represent fertility and to have played important roles in numerous rites and festivities.

                            These crudely carved art pieces represented our predecessors' initial attempts to convey their ideas in tangible form using natural materials. Traditional three-dimensional sculptures produced from these foundational artworks are:

                            Free-Standing Sculptures
                        </h2>

                        <p>
                            This is the dominant three-dimensional form that has existed since antiquity. It is, as the name implies, a standalone art item that typically depicts humans, animals, or abstract themes. Artists build sculptures out of wood, stone, or metal, and the appropriate art media is determined by the scale and intricacy of the piece.

                            Relief Sculptures

                        <p>
                            Relief carvings, as compared to free-standing sculptures, protrude from the backdrop as pieces of a bigger work of art. There are numerous forms of relief. Bas reliefs are three-dimensional compositions in which figures stand out against a backdrop. High-relief art forms, on the other hand, include sculptures that protrude prominently from the foundation.

                            Sunk relief sculpture is an art form associated with ancient Egypt in which depicted images are carved into the base.

                            Wood or Stone Carvings
                        </h2>

                        <p>
                            Carving in wood or stone is the method of cutting off bits of substance until you get the required shape. As a result, it is characterized as a reductive method. This is one of the earliest art forms, dating back to ancient times. Wood is lightweight and can handle very small details, but it does not survive long. It is uncertain how the totem pole practice evolved as a mechanism for telling ancestral stories.

                            The majority of Japan's, China's, Africa's, and Oceania's notable sculptures are made of wood. Significant ritual masks, notably in Africa, were made of wood and were elaborately crafted.

                            Casting
                        </h2>

                        <p>
                            Casting is an artistic technique usually used when dealing with metal as a medium. The process involves pouring liquid metal into pre-fabricated molds to construct massive statues. Sculptures cast in bronze are typical examples of this artistic process. However, besides metal, there are other materials that one can also cast with.

                            Concrete, epoxy, plaster of Paris, and clay are a few other examples of other time-setting materials that solidify after mixing two or more components together.

                            Glass Art

                        <p>
                            Glass art techniques entail shaping and modeling glass using warm, hot, or cold glass. Glass blowing, glass casting, and glass sculpting are among the techniques used in this artistic process. Rubbing, engraving, sandblasting, and acid etching are all typical cold glass processes.

                            Glass casting is done by pouring molten glass into a mold and allowing it to solidify.

                            Glass blowing is a method that includes collecting molten glass from a furnace and directing it through a blowpipe to make glass bubbles. Etching methods can entail adding acid to the glass's surface or blasting it with gritty materials to modify its texture and aesthetic.
