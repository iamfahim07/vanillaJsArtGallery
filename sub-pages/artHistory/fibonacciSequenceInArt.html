                            You may have heard of the golden section in your mathematics class or perhaps referred to as the golden ratio, but have you heard of the Fibonacci sequence? The Fibonacci sequence is closely connected to the golden ratio and frequently occurs in various facets of human life. From nature to space and art, the Fibonacci sequence discussed below is the formula to remember! Below is an article that will take you on a journey into the Fibonacci sequence in art as well as answer questions such as “why is the Fibonacci sequence so important?”
                        </h6>

                        <h2>
                            What Is the Fibonacci Sequence?
                        </h2>

                        <p>
                            Each object and person in the universe is made up of a unique design, including yourself if you consider that no two people share the exact same DNA makeup. Commonly referred to as “nature's code”, the Fibonacci sequence finds itself at the center of most foundational facets of human existence, including popular culture.

                            First documented in 300 BC by Greek mathematician Euclid, the Fibonacci sequence is a mathematical formula that suggests that each number is equal to the sum of the two numbers that precede it.

                            Numerically, the sequence starts with the integers 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on, continuing up to infinity! The sequence begins with a zero, followed by a one, another one, and by the fourth digit, the sequence begins by adding the last one to the two to arrive at three.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although this may be confusing to some at first, as you take a look at the visual representation of the Fibonacci sequence, you will recognize this as the golden ratio (also referred to as the divine ratio). The golden ratio (1:1.16), as visualized by the golden curve, is an ancient symbol that has possibly existed since the beginning of time.

                            The golden ratio is mostly used in design and is derived from the Fibonacci sequence to produce aesthetic visuals through proportion across art, graphic design, and architecture.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While the exact origination of the Fibonacci sequence is still under debate, multiple sources state that the formula was possibly discovered by the Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci well after 1170 AD. On the other hand, popular British mathematician, Keith Devlin, states that there are findings dating back to 200 BC consisting of texts within Hindu-Arabic numerical systems and Sanskrit writings which predate the so-called discovery made by Fibonacci.

                            A text published by Fibonacci titled “Liber Abaci”, also called the “Book of Calculus”, featured methods for calculating and tracking finances, for use by traders, using the Fibonacci sequence.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Leonardo of Pisa used an example of rabbits where if you couple two rabbits, one female and one male, and leave the rabbits to reproduce, it will result in one female and one male appearing again in the litter. Using the male and female from the first litter, if those rabbits reproduce - you are left with another litter containing another set of male-female rabbits. The cycle repeats itself and after one year, you are left with around 144 rabbits.

                            The formula applied to that result is of course none other than the Fibonacci sequence.

                        <h2>
                            What Is the Fibonacci Sequence Used For?
                        </h2>

                        <p>
                            Fibonacci numbers seem to appear in multiple areas of human existence, from orbital systems and plants to tree branches, artichokes, and pine cones. The Fibonacci sequence can also be in the pattern in which sunflowers generate new cells for seeds and even in our own solar system, where the Fibonacci series is used to determine the distances of moons of certain planets such as Saturn, Jupiter, and Uranus. So why is the Fibonacci sequence so important?

                            The importance of the Fibonacci sequence lies in the very reason why it is a topic of high debate. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Among the reasons, the one that comes to the forefront is the fact that this formula, initially thought to be exclusive to mathematics, became a formula with a ratio that appears in very specific elements in nature; plants, seed growth, and the human ear, and may be considered a universal formula.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Most evidently captured on the petals of flowers, the Fibonacci theory in the application of flowers shows that the petals of certain flowers are equal to that of the different Fibonacci numbers. The Fibonacci theory can also be seen a little more in-depth regarding flowers, cauliflowers, pineapples, and bananas. Here we refer to the Fibonacci spiral defined by the organization of seeds growing on flower heads in a spiral shape.

                        <p>
                            The Fibonacci order remains a topic of high debate but is still very much reliable in its mathematical basis.

                            It is only the speculations and hypotheses drawn from the reasoning behind why the sequence appears in many vital aspects of human life that it becomes a subject of debate. To further build on the appearance of the Fibonacci order, there exists the golden angle. The golden angle suggests that the angle at which the new growth occurs from the previous growth sits at 222.5 degrees and divides a 360-degree circle as per the golden section, which is 0.168…

                            The Rule of Thirds
                        </h2>

                        <p>
                            The rule of thirds speaks directly to a simplified version of the golden ratio where a similar approach to producing an aesthetically pleasing image is possible. From photography to painting, the rule of thirds is applied within the context of composition. To proceed with applying the rule of thirds, you would first divide your image into a grid of three by three and then place the focal point of your image or painting either two-thirds to the left or right for a horizontal image.

                            The rule of thirds can become complex, but trust your eye for symmetry and you cannot go wrong! If you get stuck, there are photographic editing software programs such as Adobe Lightroom that feature a golden ratio overlay as a guide to help you perfect your composition.
