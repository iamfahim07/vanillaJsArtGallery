                        La Primavera (c. 1477-1482) by Sandro Botticelli is a mysterious and majestic mythological tempera painting that has been pondered over by many art historians. In this article, we will explore this painting in more detail and look at the ever-brewing question: What does Primavera mean?
                        <br><br>
                        The Primavera painting, the word meaning “spring” in Italian, depicts a scene with several mythological figures in an orange grove. However, the meaning of this portrayal has been unclear to many, and for this reason, it has become widely debated by art historians over the years, with some describing it as an “enigma”.
                        There have been numerous interpretations assigned to it too, ranging from music, and philosophical Neo-Platonic ideas, to the literature and poetry of Dante, Ovid, and others.

                        Furthermore, this Primavera painting has been viewed as a portrayal of what is beautiful, bountiful, and love-filled. Some believe it was commissioned by one of the Medici family members, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de Medici, for his wedding, reportedly in 1482.
                        <br><br>
                        Another possible suggestion indicates that it was gifted to him by the wealthy Lorenzo de Medici, also known as “Lorenzo the Magnificent”, who was his cousin, for the same reason. The painting was hung behind a piece of furniture, described as a lettuccio, in the palatial home of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de Medici.

                        It is important to note that there has been significant debate about who commissioned the “Primavera” painting and what it symbolizes.

                        Many believe it was indeed a wedding gift. Giorgio Vasari also wrote about this painting and saw it at the Villa di Castello alongside Botticelli’s other famous painting, The Birth of Venus (c. 1485), which has often been described as its “companion” painting.
                        <br><br>
                        However, in the scholarly article On the Original Location of the Primavera (1975) by Webster Smith, which was published in the journal The Art Bulletin (Volume 57, Number 1, March 1975), he writes that according to some scholars, The Birth of Venus painting could have been created for another family and it is possible it was not a companion painting to La Primavera.
                        Below we will look closely at the La Primavera by Botticelli analysis in terms of the subject matter and who these mythological figures depicted are. We will then discuss the stylistic aspects in terms of Botticelli’s utilization of color, form, and space.
                        <br><br>
                        In Primavera by Sandro Botticelli, there are nine figures set in a verdant landscape, an orange grove to be specific. Surrounding them are several orange trees and other types of foliage. Beyond this forested area, we are not able to see clearly where they are in a larger location.

                        However, between the trees, there appears to be a blue background denoting the sky and hints of land to the left and right in the middle ground of the composition.

                        If we look at the figures, starting from the left, the first figure is the Roman god Mercury (Hermes in Greek mythology), who is usually described as the “messenger of the gods”, distinguished by his winged sandals and helmet. He holds a staff, otherwise known as a caduceus, up in his right hand, twirling it in what appears to be storm clouds approaching. Many sources describe him as keeping these clouds at bay.
                        There are three dancing female figures to Mercury’s left (our right). They are known as the Three Graces, or Charites, namely, Aglaïa, whose name means “shining one”; Euphrosyne, meaning “joy”; and Thalia, meaning “flourishing”.

                        They represent ideals of beauty, fertility, and charm and are depicted wearing soft and silken dresses.
                        <br><br>
                        We move now to the center of the composition, which is where we see the central figure of Venus, the Roman goddess of love. She stands further into the background than the other figures. Her head is tilted slightly to her right (our left) and her right hand is lifted at her waist. Her left hand holds on to her red robes and she serenely gazes at us, the viewers.
                        Above Venus is a smaller infantile figure of Cupid, who is blindfolded and pointing his bow and arrow towards one of the Three Graces. He is portrayed in mid-action, and we can see the tension on his face as he aims the arrow, about to shoot it.
                        Additionally, there is a visible outline around Venus’s countenance, formed by the foliage behind her. This gives a halo effect and some art history scholars have also likened it to the architectural shape of an apse, which would have surrounded depictions of the Holy Virgin Mary.

                        Looking at the figures to the right of the composition, the figure to the far right is Zephyrus, the god of the wind.

                        His entire figure and clothing are in a bluish color. We see him emerging from between tree trunks, resolutely grabbing onto the female figure to his right (our left). She is Chloris, known as a nymph of spring and flowers.

                        According to mythology, she married Zephyrus and transformed into the goddess of spring named Flora, who is the second female figure to the right of Chloris (our left). Flora gazes at us, the viewers, while she reaches her right hand to scatter rose blossoms onto the ground. Chloris is looking up at Zephyrus while barely touching or holding on to the figure of Flora.

                        This is possibly a visual depiction of her progression from a nymph to a goddess.
                        If we look at the grassy ground, Botticelli reportedly painted over 190 “botanical species” and 130 were identified, including buttercups, cornflowers, crocuses, chrysanthemums, daisies, irises, jasmines, and lilies, among others. This is another indication of the artist’s keen eye for detail and the inclusion of realism in this painting.
