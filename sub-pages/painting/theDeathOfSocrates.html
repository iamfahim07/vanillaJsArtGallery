                        The Death of Socrates (1787) by Jacques-Louis David is a poignant and impassioned portrayal of the handing over of Socrates' poison while sitting on - quite literally - his deathbed. It is furthermore a famous example of a Neoclassical painting closely connected to the French Revolution - we will explore it in more detail in this article.
                        <br><br>
                        Below we will start with a brief contextual analysis of The Death of Socrates by Jacques-Louis David, looking at the historical events that occurred when David painted it, who commissioned it, as well as how Socrates died.

                        We will then look at a formal analysis, exploring Jacques-Louis David’s stylistic approach and rendering of the painting – we will utilize several art elements and principles as guideposts to help us understand the visual components that make The Death of Socrates painting.
                        <br><br>
                        It is believed that The Death of Socrates was commissioned by either Charles-Louis or Charles-Michel Trudaine de la Sablière in 1786. However, there are scholarly debates around the validity of this as the painting could have been commissioned by the other Trudaine brother. When Jacques-Louis David completed The Death of Socrates in 1787, the political and social climate was on the cusp of the French Revolution, which started in 1789.

                        There were various reasons that catalyzed the revolution, especially the inequalities between the people and the monarchy, which was headed by King Louis XVI and his wife Marie Antoinette.
                        Jacques-Louis David was a supporter of the revolution and reportedly acquaintances with the often-termed tyrant, Maximilien Robespierre, who was a key figure in various parts of the revolution, including the Reign of Terror that occurred around 1793.
                        <br><br>
                        Robespierre was also part of the political Jacobin Club, of which David was a member.

                        However, before the events of the French Revolution Jacques-Louis David’s paintings conveyed revolutionary ideas like republicanism, patriotism, heroism, fraternity, and a return to Classical art subjects and ideals. A notable example of this includes his earlier The Oath of the Horatii (1784), which portrays a scene based on a Roman narrative.

                        Socrates was an ancient Athenian philosopher and widely known as the “founding father of Western philosophy”. He reportedly did not write any of his philosophical beliefs and ideals and expressed these through oration.

                        His legacy was continued through his students Plato and Xenophon, who were also philosophers from Athens.

                        They wrote various texts that are often referred to as the “Socratic dialogues” related to Socrates’ teachings and dialogues. Plato covered Socrates’ fate – from his trial to his death – in four dialogues, namely, Euthyphro (c. 380 BCE), the Apology (c. 399 to 387 BCE), Crito (c. 360 BCE), and finally, Phaedo (C. 360 BCE).

                        Phaedo was about Socrates’ time in prison and his imminent death, which was by drinking hemlock – a poisonous plant. However, the question arises: Why was Socrates in prison? He was tried for several crimes, such as “corrupting the youth” with his ideas and philosophies. As a result, he was sentenced to death.

                        Socrates did not compromise on what he believed in and chose to die instead, surrounded by his students.
                        <br><br>
                        Phaedo explored his last dialogues about the soul and its immortality – reportedly the title was also understood to be On the Soul for those who lived during the ancient times. Plato also wrote it from the viewpoint of Phaedo of Elis, who narrated the story to the Pythagorean philosopher Echecrates.
