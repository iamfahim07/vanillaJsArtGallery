                        In the Sistine Chapel, hands become more than just hands. The Creation of Adam by Michelangelo is one of the frescoes that adorn this Vatican City chapel in Rome. It has been a familiar and sought-after sight for many around the world for centuries, which we will discuss in the article below.
                        <br><br>
                        The Sistine Chapel tells a story to anyone who enters its space, physically or virtually. It is a treasure trove of frescoes, a home to hundreds of painted figures who are all part of a Biblical narrative, occupying its walls and ceiling. Let us take a brief tour of the Sistine Chapel to understand where The Creation of Adam by Michelangelo fits in.

                        The Sistine Chapel, named “Cappella Sistina” in Italian, is in the Vatican City in Rome, Italy. It forms part of the Apostolic Palace, which is known as the “formal residence” of the Pope.

                        Although the Apostolic Palace is where official religious and administrative practices take place concerning the Papacy, it is also a site of significant artworks and architecture, and home to the Vatican Museums. The Sistine Chapel was built from 1473 to around 1480/1481 by the request of Pope Sixtus IV. Interestingly, the chapel was named after Pope Sixtus IV, the word “Sistine” derives from the Italian word sistino and is commonly defined as “of or relating to the Pope Sixtus”.
                        <br><br>
                        The Sistine Chapel was a renovation project, rebuilding the site of the older Cappella Magna, which was close to ruin. Many sources about the history and design of the chapel refer to two architects, namely, Giovanni de Dolci and Baccio Pontelli. Pope Sixtus IV also commissioned several artists to paint the interior North and South walls; The North wall depicts the Life of Christ, and the South wall depicts the Life of Moses. Among the artists were Sandro Botticelli and Domenico Ghirlandaio.

                        Below these panels, on either side, are what is known as “trompe l’oeil” draperies, which means they give the illusion of being real.

                        These walls were also intended to hang real tapestries designed by Raphael, a commission made by Pope Leo X in 1515. Raphael’s tapestries depicted the lives of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, and the designs were known famously as the Raphael Cartoons. There were originally 10 designs, however, only seven are left and on display at the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A) based in London.

                        In 1508, Pope Julius II commissioned Michelangelo to repaint the Sistine Chapel ceiling, it was originally painted in blue with golden dots denoting stars by Piermatteo D’Amelia. Reportedly, the Pope asked for a depiction of the 12 Apostles, but Michelangelo proposed a more elaborate subject matter, which resulted in what we see on the Sistine Chapel ceiling today.

                        The Sistine Chapel ceiling by Michelangelo depicts several stories from the Old Testament in the Holy Bible.

                        Just above each of the North and South walls are a series of lunettes, which depict the ancestors/forefathers of Jesus Christ. There are four large pendentives, which are triangular in each corner, depicting scenes about Israel’s salvation. Along the border of the ceiling, in line with the pendentives, we will notice smaller triangular shapes, commonly knowns as spandrels.

                        These have been thought to depict more family/ancestors of Jesus Christ.

                        In between the spandrels and pendentives, there are 12 figures of alternating Prophets and Sibyls all relating to their foreseeing of the coming of Jesus Christ. The next panel consists of what is known as the central paintings, which composes of nine horizontally shaped panels, which are grouped as threes and decorated with medallions and male nudes referred to as ignudi.

                        The central stories are from the Bible’s Book of Genesis and are painted to be viewed starting from the altar, which is on the East side of the Sistine Chapel. The first group of three scenes is about the creation of the heavens and earth. These start with The Separation of Light from Darkness, The Creation of the Sun, Moon, and Plants, and The Separation of Land from Sea.

                        Here, we see the strong and powerful figure of God actively dominant in the scenes.The next three scenes depict the creation of man painting scenes, namely The Creation of Adam painting, which we will discuss in more detail below. This is followed by The Creation of Eve and The Original Sin and Banishment from the Garden of Eden. The last three scenes depict the story of Noah, namely, The Sacrifice of Noah, The Flood, and The Drunkenness of Noah. This set of paintings is closer to the entrance of the chapel, which is on the West side
                        <br><br>
                        An interesting point to note is that it is believed The Creation of Adam painting was inspired by the hymn titled Veni, Creator Spiritus by Rabanus Maurus. According to a translation from the Vatican, in the hymn’s third stanza it is written, as “finger of God’s right hand”, in Latin it is “dextrae Dei tu digitus”. Other translations describe it as the “finger of God’s hand”.
                        If we look at the essence of it, it refers to God’s power as a creator of life.

                        Additionally, in the art scholar Paul Barolsky’s article Michelangelo and the Spirit of God, published in Source: Notes in the History of Art (Volume 17, Number 4, 1998), he connects the meaning of the word spiritus to “wind” or “breath”, which Michelangelo depicted in The Creation of Adam and the source of wind we notice in the drapery and hair. 
                        
                        Furthermore, God is almost like the breath of creation, His creation being Adam. Barolsky also mentions that Michelangelo could have found inspiration from Sandro Botticelli’s god of wind Zephyr in The Birth of Venus (c. 1484-1486). There are similarities between the position of Zephyr’s body and God’s body, which appears to be floating in the air as if buoyed by the wind.
