                        If you enjoy Greek/Roman mythology, you probably know of the Greek Titan called Kronos, the god of time. You know, the one who ate his own children? This is the subject we will be exploring in the painting Saturn Devouring One of His Sons (c. 1819-1823) by Francisco Goya.
                        <br><br>
                        Francisco Goya was one of the leading Spanish painters from the Romanticism art movement, but he is widely regarded and described as one of the “last old masters” and the “father of Modern art”. He painted within a variety of genres, from portrait paintings of prominent figures from the Spanish Royal Court to war paintings influenced by the Peninsular War from 1808 to 1814.

                        He was also remembered for exploring more fantastical and grotesque subject matter notably in his “Black Paintings” series, which consisted of 14 murals, done around 1819 to 1823 on the walls in his house, Quinta del Sordo, which was a two-story house located outside of Madrid.

                        The date range is around 1819 to 1823 for all the Black Paintings, additionally, Goya reportedly did not name the paintings; the paintings were possibly titled when they were inventoried by Antonio Brugada in 1828.

                        However, other art scholars may have titled them throughout the years of their analysis.

                        In 1874, Baron Frédéric Émile d’Erlanger started the project for the paintings’ removal and placement onto canvas; he bought the house in 1873. The Baron donated the paintings to the Museo del Prado around 1880/1881 after exhibiting them at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1878.

                        Before we discuss the painting in more depth, it will be useful to know more about who Saturn was, and to answer the inevitable question of why did Saturn devour his son in the first place? He was the Roman god attributed to the harvest and agriculture.

                        He was based on the original Greek god Kronos, also known as Cronus, who was a Titan (the king/leader of the Titans, often described as the “Titan King”) as well as the deity of harvests and time. 

                        According to a prophecy, Kronos’ son Zeus was next in line to take his father’s place, and to prevent his downfall he decided to eat his children. Interestingly, Kronos castrated and killed his own father who was Uranus. Kronos’ mother, Gaia, was married to Uranus and wanted to kill him, of which Kronos became the main usurper.

                        Francisco Goya’s interpretation of Saturn cannibalizing his children was not the only depiction of the Greek myth. We are also reminded of Saturn (c. 1636-1638) by the Baroque painter Peter Paul Rubens. Here, Rubens depicted Saturn as an elderly man holding a long stick in his right hand (our left), which has been described as a “scythe”, one of his symbols. In his left hand (our right) is his infant child, writhing in pain and fear, still alive, as Saturn is in the act of eating him.

                        Although the subject matter is ghastly and not suitable for sensitive viewers, it nonetheless lacks the outright blatancy and darkness we see in Goya’s portrayal of the scene. It has also been suggested that Goya could have been influenced by Rubens’s painting of the scene.

                        Additionally, Francisco Goya’s rendition is imbued with the tenets of Romanticism, which sought more expressive and dramatic depictions of subject matter. Artists also explored what they felt, moving away from art that was more calculated and based on reason, notably History paintings during the Neoclassical art period.

                        Saturn, Anti-Semitism, and Spain have one thing in common, and that is Francisco Goya. There are various scholarly interpretations of what could have influenced or inspired Goya to paint Saturn Devouring His Son. However, it is important to note that there has been extensive research done on the meaning of this painting, and there are numerous theories that reach for a rational answer.
                        Below are several of the more common theories you will come across when reading more about Goya’s Saturn.

                        Some scholars suggest that Goya could have been influenced by the war between Spain and France during the early 1800s and personifying it through the figure of Saturn as the country devouring its people. Others suggest that maybe Goya was affected by the losses of several of his children, of whom one survived, whose name was Javier Goya. Furthermore, Francisco Goya also became ill while he was living at the Quinta del Sordo and reportedly experienced anxiety and fear of getting old.

                        Another theory by the art historian Fred Licht is around the false stories about blood libels held by Jewish people who would sacrifice Christian children for their blood and the Jews’ fears around the allegations. This was reportedly something Goya may have come across in Spain because the falsified stories were spread around Europe and possibly caught his attention.

                        The identity of Goya’s Saturn has also been questioned because the main antagonist is not portrayed with the items or symbols that identify him, such as the scythe, as we have mentioned above in Peter Paul Rubens’ painting. There are also questions raised about why Francisco Goya depicted the child as an adult and not the typical infant from other renditions.

                        This also ties in with the titles given to the paintings; some scholars suggest that one should avoid trying to liken the paintings with the subject matter too much because we cannot know for sure what Goya’s intention or meaning was for each.

                        Additionally, it is also suggested that Goya painted the murals for himself and not for public display. It is interesting to note here that Francisco Goya explored the mythological tale several years before his Black Paintings. He made a drawing in red chalk on laid paper of the same title in around 1797 as part of his preparatory drawings for his Los Caprichos series.

                        Goya depicted an older man in this drawing, assumedly Saturn, and he is in the process of eating one of his sons, chomping down on his left leg while he hangs upside down. In Saturn’s left hand (our right) is another male figure who appears to be hunched over with his head in his hands as if he knows the dreaded death awaiting him.

                        Interestingly, Goya depicted the two victims as adult men, and not infants, which is echoes the adult figure in his later mural. Additionally, the figure of Saturn appears malevolent in his manner, his eyes are fixed, and he has an unsettling smile or grimace while he eats the figure. Saturn also has the same untidy hair.
